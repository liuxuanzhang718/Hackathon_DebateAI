VeriVox is an innovative AI-powered debate platform that combines symbolic logic validation with voice-assisted interaction, creating an immersive and structured learning experience for debate enthusiasts.

## Core Features

### Voice-Oriented Interaction
- üéôÔ∏è **Real-time AI Speech**: Powered by ElevenLabs for natural-sounding AI voice interaction
- üîä **Audio Visualization**: Dynamic particle system reflecting voice states and user engagement
- üó£Ô∏è **Voice Recognition**: Seamless speech-to-text processing for natural conversation

### Logic and Reasoning
- ‚ö° **Symbolic Logic Engine**: Custom-built validator for argument consistency checking
- üß† **AI-Powered Analysis**: Integration with GPT-4o for natural language understanding
- üìö **Interactive Logic Tutorial**: Learn five fundamental logic symbols (And, Or, Not, If‚Ä¶then, If and only if)

### Social and Gaming Elements
- üéÆ **Multiplayer Mode**: Real-time debate sessions with other users
- üèÜ **Achievement System**: Track progress and earn rewards
- üë• **Community Features**: Engage with other debaters and share experiences

## Usage & Interface
After logging in, users can choose to start a new debate, interact with the AI agent, or access the tutorial page to learn basic logic symbols.

In the settings page, users can customize both the voice and role of their AI agent. We're grateful to ElevenLabs for providing a diverse range of natural-sounding voices.

Once personalization is complete, users can proceed to the tutorial page to learn the basic logic symbols. The tutorial provides examples to help users determine the truth value of different arguments. Users will master five fundamental logic symbols: And, Or, Not, If‚Ä¶then, and If and only if.

After completing the tutorial, users can begin their debate training with the AI agent. Users select their position in the argument and interact by tapping the central particle ball to start and stop recording their arguments.

The system then displays a clear logical flow diagram of the argument. The AI agent analyzes this structure and responds by typically challenging the premises on the left side of the logic flow. Any logical contradictions are highlighted in yellow.
